This file contains a list of potential problems and known bugs:

1) hyperref: The documentation and sample thesis use this package.
If it is not availible, you might have problems.  You can download it
from www.ctan.org.  Forcing LaTeX to ignore it is not much of a
problem though.

2) READMe: The README file is there, but does not list with some
browsers.  I am not sure why or how to fix this
