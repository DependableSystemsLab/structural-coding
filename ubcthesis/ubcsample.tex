%************************************************
% Optional packages.
%
% The use of these packages is optional, but they provide various
% tools for more flexible formating.  The sample thesis uses these,
% but if you remove the example code, you should be able to exclude
% these packages.  Only standard packages have been described here;
% they should be installed with any complete LaTeX instalation, but
% if not, you can find them at the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network
% (CTAN): http://www.ctan.org/
%

%******** afterpage ***************************
% This package allows you to issue commands at the end of the current
% page.  A good use for this is to use the command
% \afterpage{\clearpage} right after a figure.  This will cause the
% figure to be inserted on the page following the current one (or on
% the current page if it will fit) but will not break the page in the
% middle.
\usepackage{afterpage}

%******** float *********************************
% This package allows you to customize the style of
% "floats"---floating objects such as figures and tables.  In
% addition, it allows you to define additional floating objects which
% may be included in a list similar to that produces by \listoftables
% and \listoffigures.  Common uses include introducing floats for
% programs and other code bits in Compute Science and Chemical Schema.
\usepackage{float}

%******** tocloft *******************************
% This package allows you to customize and define custom lists such
% as a list of programs or Chemical Scheme.  Note: if you use the
% subfigure package, you must specify that you do as an option here.
% The title option uses the default formatting.  We do not use this
% here as the default formatting is acceptable.  Use the float
% package instead unless you need the extra formatting control
% provided by tocloft.
%\usepackage[subfigure, titles]{tocloft}

%******** alltt *********************************
% The alltt package allows you to include files and have them
% formatted in a verbatim fashion.  This is useful for including
% source code from an additional file.
%\usepackage{alltt}

%******** listings ******************************
% The listings package may be used to include chunks of source code
% and has facilities for pretty-printing many languages.
%\usepackage{listings}

%******** longtable *****************************
% The longtable package allows you to define tables that span
% multiple pages.
\usepackage{longtable}

%******** graphics and graphicx *****************
% This allows you to include encapsulated postscript files.  If you
% don't have this, comment the \includegraphics{} line following the
% comment "%includegraphics" later in this file.
\usepackage{graphicx}

%******** subfigure *****************************
% The subfigure package allows you to include multiple figures and
% captions within a single figure environment.
%\usepackage{subfigure}

%******** here **********************************
% The here package gives you more control over the placement of
% figures and tables.  In particular, you can specify the placement
% "H" which means "Put the figure here" rather than [h] which means
% "I would suggest that you put the figure here if you think it looks
% good."
%\usepackage{here}

%******** pdflscape ********************************
% This allows you to include landscape layout pages by using the
% |landscape| environment.  The use of |pdflscape| is preferred over
% the standard |lscape| package because it automatically rotates the
% page in the pdf file for easier reading.  (Thanks to Joseph Shea
% for pointing this out.)
\usepackage{pdflscape}

%******** natbib ********************************
% This is a very nice package for bibliographies.  It includes options
% for sorting and compressing bibliographic entries.
\usepackage[numbers,sort&compress]{natbib}

%******** psfrag ******************************
% This allows you to replace text in postscript pictures with formated
% latex text.  This allows you to use math in graph labels
% etc. Uncomment the psfrag lines following the "%psfrag" comment
% later in this file if you don't have this package.  The replacements
% will only be visible in the final postscript file: they will be
% listed in the .dvi file but not performed.
\usepackage{psfrag}

%******** hyperref *****************************
% Please read the manual:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html
%
% This adds hyperlinks to your document: with the right viewers (later
% versions of xdvi, acrobat with pdftex, latex2html etc.) this will
% make your equation, figure, citation references etc. hyperlinks so
% that you can click on them.  Also, your table of contents will be
% able to take you to the appropriate sections.  In the viewers that
% support this, the links often appear with an underscore.  This
% underscore will not appear in printed versions.
%
% Note: if you do not use the hypertex option, then the dvips driver
% may be loaded by default.  This will cause the entries in the list
% of figures and list of tables to be on a single line because dvips
% does not deal with hyperlinks on broken lines properly.
%
% NOTE: HYPERREF is sensitive to the ORDER in which it is LOADED.
% For example, it must be loaded AFTER natbib but BEFORE newly
% defined float environments.  See the README file with the hyperref
% for some help with this.  If you have some very obscure errors, try
% first disabling hyperref.  If that fixes the problem, try various
% orderings.
%
% Note also that there is a bug with versions before 2003/11/30
% v6.74m that cause the float package to not function correctly.
% Please ensure you have a current version of this package.  A
% warning will be issued if you leave the date below but do not have
% a current version installed.
%
% Some notes on options: depending on how you build your files, you
% may need to choose the appropriate option (such as [pdftex]) for the
% backend driver (see the hyperref manual for a complete list).  Also,
% the default here is to make links from the page numbers in the table
% of contents and lists of figures etc.  There are other options:
% excluding the [linktocpage] option will make the entire text a
% hyperref, but for some backends will prevent the text from wrapping
% which can look terrible.  There is a [breaklinks=true] option that
% will be set if the backend supports (dvipdfm for example supports
% it but does not work with psfrag.)
%
% Finally, there are many options for choosing the colours of the
% links.  These will be included by default in future versions but
% you should probably consider changing some now for the electronic
% version of your thesis.
\usepackage[unicode=true,
  linktocpage,
  linkbordercolor={0.5 0.5 1},
  citebordercolor={0.5 1 0.5},
  linkcolor=blue]{hyperref}

% If you would like to compile this sample thesis without the
% hyperref package, then you will need to comment out the previous
% \usepackage command and uncomment the following command which will
% put the URL's in a typewriter font but not link them.
%\newcommand\url[1]{\texttt{#1}}

%******** setspace *******************************
% The setspace package allows you to manually set the spacing of the
% file.  UBC may require 1.5 spacing for microfilming of theses.  In
% this case you may obtain this by including this package and issuing
% one of the following commands:
%\usepackage{setspace}
%\singlespacing
%\onehalfspacing
%\doublespacing

% These commands are optional.  The defaults are shown.  You only
% need to include them if you need a different value

% If you are at the Okanagan campus, then you should specify these
% instead.

\chapter{Preface} % Manditory if any of the conditions are met

You must include a preface if any part of your research was partly or
wholly published in articles, was part of a collaboration, or required
the approval of UBC Research Ethics Boards.

The Preface must include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item A statement indicating the relative contributions of all
  collaborators and co-authors of publications (if any), emphasizing
  details of your contribution, and stating the proportion of research
  and writing conducted by you.
\item A list of any publications arising from work presented in the
  dissertation, and the chapter(s) in which the work is located.
\item The name of the particular UBC Research Ethics Board, and the
  Certificate Number(s) of the Ethics Certificate(s) obtained, if
  ethics approval was required for the research.
\end{itemize}

%%% Sections and subsections etc. in the Preface should in general
%%% not be listed in the table of contents, so use the starred form
%%% of \section etc.
\section*{Examples}
Chapter~\ref{cha:apple_ref} is based on work conducted in UBC's Maple
Syrup Laboratory by Dr. A.  Apple, Professor B. Boat, and Michael
McNeil Forbes. I was responsible for tapping the trees in forests X
and Z, conducted and supervised all boiling operations, and performed
frequent quality control tests on the product.

A version of chapter~\ref{cha:apple_ref} has been
published~\cite{Apple:2010}. I conducted all the testing and wrote
most of the manuscript. The section on ``Testing Implements'' was
originally drafted by Boat, B.  Check the first pages of this
chapter to see footnotes with similar information.

Note that this preface must come before the table of contents.  Note
also that this section ``Examples'' should not be listed in the table
of contents, so we have used the starred form: \verb|\section*{Example}|.

\tableofcontents                %% Mandatory
\listoftables                   %% Mandatory if thesis has tables
\listoffigures                  %% Mandatory if thesis has figures
\listof{Program}{List of Programs} %% Optional
%% Any other lists should come here, i.e.
%% Abbreviation schemes, definitions, lists of formulae, list of
%% schemes, glossary, list of symbols etc.

\chapter{Acknowledgements}      %% Optional
This is the place to thank professional colleagues and people who have
given you the most help during the course of your graduate work.

\chapter{Dedication} %% Optional
The dedication is usually quite short, and is a personal rather than
an academic recognition.  The \emph{Dedication} does not have to be
titled, but it must appear in the table of contents.  If you want to
skip the chapter title but still enter it into the Table of Contents,
use this command \verb|\chapter[Dedication]{}|.

Note that this section is the last of the preliminary pages (with
lowercase Roman numeral page numbers).  It must be placed
\emph{before} the \verb|\mainmatter| command.  After that, Arabic
numbered pages will begin.

% Any other unusual prefactory material should come here before the
% main body.

% Now regular page numbering begins.

\chapter{Background and Terminology}
\chapter{Protecting Quantized CNNs against Rowhammer through Adversarial Training}
\chapter{Measuring Fault Resilience of CNNs against Weight Faults}
\chapter{Some Parameters are more Equal}

\section{Introduction}
There are a variety of studies confirming that some parameters of deep neural networks (DNNs) play a more important role in the process of inference. These studies include but are not limited to DNN compression through weight pruning, saliency analysis of network parameters, and ranking most influential parameters for performing weight perturbation attacks. Yet, the criticality of parameters in sense of being vulnerable to bit flips in presence of range restriction techniques is not investigated. In this chapter we analyze the case of ResNet50 image classifier with and without range restriction protection applied. 


\section{Experimental Setup}
In this experiment we used ResNet50 as an image classifier. We used observed ranges from 20\% of training data set for clipper protection. First we sampled 1000 out of ImageNet validation images and then selected the 80 images causing most of the SDCs overall. 

To report the retrieval measures (i.e. precision and recall) we reduce the search space to 4000 randomly selected parameters uniformly across all the network. Further we report values for a technique which is capable of protecting 10\% of the parameters (i.e. 400 parameters). The reported values in the result graphs are for selection of these 400 parameters out of 4000 assisted with some injection trials. In each technique, first the parameters are ranked. Then the number of trials are performed to verify the top ranking parameters. This verification obtains some parameters that are critical for sure and some parameters that are non-critical for sure. The certain critical parameters are selected to be protected and the reset of the 400 parameter protection budget is filled with the rest of top-ranking parameters. This way we will always have a resulting set of 400 parameters out of 4000 parameters. True-positive is number of critical parameters among these 400, false-positive is number of non-critical parameters among these 400, true-negative is the number of non-critical parameters kept out of these 400, and false-negative is the number of critical parameters kept out.

To calculate the heuristics the gradient value is calculated regarding the cross entropy loss with regard to the 80 images. In the graphs $value$ means the value of the parameter and $grad$ the gradient calculated for that parameter. 


\section{Results}

Whereas ranking the parameters by the heuristic $value/|grad|$ seems promising both with and without applying clipper as a protection technique as demonstrated in Figure \ref{heuristic_layers:all}, it turns out to be a proxy to identify the parameters which are in the last layer. If we plot the same measures excluding the injections to the parameters of the last layer as demonstrated in Figure \ref{heuristic_layers:wolast}, we will see that $|grad|$ will be a better heuristic after applying clipper protection. Nevertheless, $value/|grad|$ remains dominant if we don't protect the network.

\section{A Section}
Here is a section with some text.  Equations look like this
$y=x$.\footnote{Here is a footnote.}

This is an example of a second paragraph in a section so you can
see how much it is indented by.

% Subsections follow
\subsection{This is a Subsection}
Here is an example of a citation: \cite{Forbes:2006ba}.  The actual
form of the citation is governed by the bibliographystyle.  These
citations are maintained in a BIBTeX file \texttt{sample.bib}.  You
could type these directly into the file.  For an example of the format
to use look at the file \texttt{ubcsample.bbl} after you compile this
file.\footnote{Here is another footnote.}

This is an example of a second paragraph in a subsection so you can
see how much it is indented by.

\subsubsection{This is a Subsubsection}
Here are some more citations \cite{LL3:1977,Peccei:1989,Turner:1999}.
If you use the \texttt{natbib} package with the \verb+sort&compress+
option, then the following citation will look the same as the first
citation in this section: \cite{Turner:1999,Peccei:1989,LL3:1977}.

This is an example of a second paragraph in a subsubsection so you can
see how much it is indented by.

\paragraph{This is a Paragraph}
Paragraphs and subparagraphs are the smallest units of text.  There is
no subsubsubsection etc.

\subparagraph{This is a Subparagraph}
This is the last level of organisation.  If you need more than this,
you should consider reorganizing your work\dots

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{f}(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\int_{-\infty}^x
    e^{-\frac{y^2}{2}}\mathrm{d}{y}}e^{-z^2}\mathrm{d}z
\end{equation}

In order to show you what a separate page would look like (i.e. without
a chapter heading) I must type some more text.  Thus I will babble a
bit and keep babbling for at least one more page\ldots  What you
should notice is that the chapter titles appear substantially lower
than the continuing text. Babble babble

\section{Quote}
Here is a quote:

    a little poem, a Haiku,\\
    to show you how to.\\
    ---Michael M$^{\rm c}$Neil Forbes.
  \end{center}
\end{quote}

This small poem shows several features:
\begin{itemize}
\item The use of the \verb|quote| and \verb|center| environments.
\item The \verb|\newpage| command has been used to force a page
  break.  (Sections do not usually start on a new page.)
\item The pagestyle has been set to suppress the headers using the
  command \verb|\thispagestyle{plain}|.  Note that using
  \verb|\pagestyle{plain}| would have affected all of the subsequent
  pages.
\end{itemize}
\section{Programs}
Here we give an example of a new float as defined using the
\texttt{float} package.  In the preamble we have used the commands
\begin{verbatim}
\floatstyle{ruled}
\newfloat{Program}{htbp}{lop}[chapter]
\end{verbatim}
This creates a ``Program'' environment that may be used for program
fragments.  A sample \texttt{python} program is shown in
Program~\ref{prog:fib}.  (Note that Python places a fairly restrictive
limit on recursion so trying to call this with a large $n$ before
building up the cache is likely to fail unless you increase the
recursion depth.)
\begin{Program}
  \caption{\label{prog:fib} Python program that computes the $n^{\rm
      th}$ Fibonacci number using memoization.}
\begin{verbatim}
def fib(n,_cache={}):
    if n < 2:
        return 1
    if n in _cache:
        return _cache[n]
    else:
        result = fib(n-1)+fib(n-2)
        _cache[n] = result
        return result
\end{verbatim}
\end{Program}
Instead of using a \texttt{verbatim} environment for your program
chunks, you might like to \texttt{include} them within an
\texttt{alltt} envrironment by including the \verb|\usepackage{alltt}|
package (see page 187 of the \LaTeX{} book).  Another useful package
is the \verb|\usepackage{listings}| which can pretty-print many
different types of source code.

% Force a new page

%% Here we provide a short optional argument to \chapter[]{}.  This
%% optional argument will appear in the table of contents.  For long
%% titles, one should use this to give a single-line entry to the
%% table of contents.
\chapter[Another Chapter\ldots]{Another Chapter with a Very Long
  Chapter-name that will Probably Cause Problems}
\label{cha:apple_ref}

This chapter name is very long and does not display properly in the
running headers or in the table of contents.  To deal with this, we
provide a shorter version of the title as the optional argument to the
\verb|\chapter[]{}| command.

For example, this chapter's title and associated table of contents heading and
running header was created with\\
\verb|\chapter[Another Chapter\ldots]{Another Chapter with a Very Long|\\
\verb|Chapter-name that will Probably Cause Problems}|.

Note that, according to the thesis regulations, the heading included
in the table of contents must be a truncation of the actual heading.

This Chapter was used as a demonstration in the Preface for how to
attribute contribution from collaborators.  If there are any such
contributions, details must be included in the Preface.  If you wish,
you may additionally use a footnote such as this.\footnote{This
  chapter is based on work conducted in UBC's Maple Syrup Laboratory
  by Dr. A. Apple, Professor B. Boat, and C. Cat.}

\section{Another Section}

    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{fig}
    \caption[Happy Face: figure example.]{\label{fig:happy} This is a figure of
      a happy face with a \texttt{psfrag} replacement.  The original figure
      (drawn in xfig and exported to a .eps file) has the text ``pie makes me
      happy!''.  The \texttt{psfrag} package replaces this with ``$\pi$ makes me
      happy!''.  Note: the Makefile compiles the sample using pdf\LaTeX\ which
      cannot use \texttt{psfrag} directly.  For some options that work with
      pdf\LaTeX, please see this discussion:
      \url{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/11839}.  For the caption, we
      have used the optional argument for the caption command so that only a
      short version of this caption occurs in the list of figures.}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
\afterpage{\clearpage}
Here is an example of a figure environment.
Perhaps I should say that the example of a figure can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:happy}.  Figure placement can be tricky with \LaTeX\
because figures and tables are treated as ``floats'': text can flow
around them, but if there is not enough space, they will appear later.
To prevent figures from going too far, the
\verb|\afterpage{\clearpage}| command can be used.  This makes sure
that the figure are typeset at the end of the page (possibly appear on
their own on the following pages) and before any subsequent text.

The \verb|\clearpage| forces a page break so that the figure can be
placed, but without the the \verb|\afterpage{}| command, the page
would be broken too early (at the \verb|\clearpage| statement).  The
\verb|\afterpage{}| command tells \LaTeX{} to issue the command after
the present page has been rendered.

\section{Tables}
We have already included one table:~\ref{tab:Table1}.  Another table
is plopped right here.
\begin{table}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l||l|l||l|l|}
      \hline
      &\multicolumn{2}{l|}{Singular}&\multicolumn{2}{l|}{Plural}\\
      \cline{2-5}
       &English&\textbf{Gaeilge}&English&\textbf{Gaeilge}\\
      \hline\hline
      1st Person&at me&\textbf{agam}&at us&\textbf{againn}\\
      2nd Person&at you&\textbf{agat}&at you&\textbf{agaibh}\\
      3rd Person&at him&\textbf{aige}&at them&\textbf{acu}\\
       &at her&\textbf{aici}& & \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{
      \label{tab:Table2}
      Another table.}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
Well, actually, as with Figures, tables do not
necessarily appear right ``here'' because tables are also ``floats''.
\LaTeX{} puts them where it can.  Because of this, one should refer to
floats by their labels rather than by their location.  This example is
demonstrated by Table~\ref{tab:Table2}.  This one is pretty close,
however.  (Note: you should generally not put tables or figures in the
middle of a paragraph.  This example is for demonstration purposes
only.)

Another useful package is \verb|\usepackage{longtable}| which provides
the \texttt{longtable} environment.  This is nice because it allows
tables to span multiple pages.  Table~\ref{tab:longtable} has been
formatted this way.
\begin{center}
  \begin{longtable}{|l|l|l|}
    \caption{\label{tab:longtable}Feasible triples for
      highly variable Grid}\\

    \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textbf{Time (s)}} &

\subsection*{An Unnumbered Subsection}
Note that if you use subsections or further divisions under an
unnumbered section, then you should make them unnumbered as well
otherwise you will end up with zeros in the section numbering.

\chapter{Landscape Mode}
The landscape mode allows you to rotate a page through 90 degrees.  It
is generally not a good idea to make the chapter heading landscape,
but it can be useful for long tables etc.

\begin{landscape}
  This text should appear rotated, allowing for formatting of very
  wide tables etc.  Note that this might only work after you convert
  the \texttt{dvi} file to a postscript (\texttt{ps}) or \texttt{pdf}
  file using \texttt{dvips} or \texttt{dvipdf} etc.  This feature is
  provided by the \verb|lscape| and the \verb|pdflscape| packages.
  The latter is preferred if it works as it also rotates the pages in
  the pdf file for easier viewing.
\end{landscape}

\bibliography{sample}

%% Use this to reset the appendix counter.  Note that the FoGS
%% requires that the word ``Appendices'' appear in the table of

\chapter{First Appendix}
Here you can have your appendices.  Note that if you only have a
single appendix, you should issue
\verb|\renewcommand{\appendicesname}{Appendix}| before calling
\verb|\appendix| to display the singular ``Appendix'' rather than the
default plural ``Appendices''.

\chapter{Second Appendix}
Here is the second appendix.

%% This changes the headings and chapter titles (no numbers for

\chapter*{Additional Information}
This chapter shows you how to include additional information in your
thesis, the removal of which will not affect the submission.  Such
material should be removed before the thesis is actually submitted.

First, the chapter is unnumbered and not included in the Table of
Contents.  Second, it is the last section of the thesis, so its
removal will not alter any of the page numbering etc. for the previous
sections.  Do not include any floats, however, as these will appear in
the initial lists.

The \texttt{ubcthesis} \LaTeX{} class has been designed to aid you in
producing a thesis that conforms to the requirements of The
University of British Columbia Faculty of Graduate Studies (FoGS).

Proper use of this class and sample is highly recommended---and should
produce a well formatted document that meets the FoGS requirement.
Notwithstanding, complex theses may require additional formatting that
may conflict with some of the requirements.  We therefore \emph{highly
  recommend} that you consult one of the FoGS staff for assistance and
an assessment of potential problems \emph{before} starting final
draft.

While we have attemped to address most of the thesis formatting
requirements in these files, they do not constitute an official set of
thesis requirements.  The official requirements are available at the
following section of the FoGS web site:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|}
    \hline
    \url{http://www.grad.ubc.ca/current-students/dissertation-thesis-preparation}\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
We recommend that you review these instructions carefully.
